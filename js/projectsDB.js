        Description of the application: an application for listening,
        creating, and sharing a music playlist. Similar to Spotify.
        Only with collaborative content, such as podcasts or YouTube Live.
        Users can enter a certain playlist to listen to it together, edit it - for all its features,
        change the order of the songs, correspond in a unique chat for each playback room, and more...',
        the application includes full CRUDL and uses a REST API to send requests to the server and
        receive or manage Information and includes different services and rates according
        to each entity in the database. Communication between users.
        Also, full synchronization of information between users is carried out by sockets
        sent from the client side to the server side and back.
        Use of an external API: in order to play the songs,
        a library is used that plays songs through YouTube servers.
        Songs and song searches are also done through the Google API (YouTube)
        in addition, there is also the use of the drag and drop library in order to manage the order of songs
        in a certain playlist while updating the server in Live Design: the design is also mine,
        the logo is also in the app, and the fonts. UX was also developed by me and is based on Spotify's UX,`,
